# Video Guidelines for PythonVids - Broken English and Locals…

### Comprehensive Guide for Creating PythonVids: Video Production Standards

---

This guide outlines the necessary standards and best practices for creating video content for PythonEducationVid/PythonVids. These guidelines are designed to ensure consistency, quality, and a positive learning experience for our diverse audience. All video creators are expected to adhere strictly to these requirements.

### 1. **Video Styles**

Creators can choose from the following styles to present their educational content:

- **Screen Recordings**:
    
    Ideal for tutorials involving coding and software demonstrations. The screen should clearly display all code, outputs, or diagrams in a readable format.
    
- **In-Person Explanation/Demonstration**:
    
    Creators can explain concepts on camera or via a physical demonstration (such as using a whiteboard, or showing hardware if necessary). Proper lighting, clear audio, and a clutter-free background are required.
    
- **Combination**:
    
    A mix of screen recordings and in-person explanations can be used where necessary to break down complex topics and enhance understanding.

### 2. **Required Components (Software & Hardware)**

Depending on the style chosen, creators should ensure they have access to the following tools:

- **Software**:
    - Screen recording software (e.g., OBS Studio, Camtasia, or similar)
    - Video editing software for post-production (e.g., DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere)
    - Python installed for live coding demonstrations (if necessary)
- **Hardware**:
    - A microphone for clear audio
    - A camera (if in-person explanations are used) with at least 1080p resolution
    - Good lighting setup to ensure video clarity and avoid shadows (if recording in person)

### 3. **Video Quality Standards**

- **Clarity**:
    
    Both screen recordings and camera footage must be of high resolution. All videos must be recorded in at least 1080p HD for clarity.
    
    - **Screen Recording**: Text should be large enough to read without zooming, and avoid distracting background applications or icons.
    - **Camera Recording**: Should have proper framing, with the speaker clearly visible and centered.
- **Audio**:
    
    Audio must be crisp, with minimal background noise. Creators should invest in a good quality microphone or ensure that audio recorded via a laptop/phone is clear.

### 4. **Content Guidelines**

The following guidelines ensure that content remains professional, inclusive, and aligned with our goals:

- **No Misleading Information**:
    
    All tutorials must be accurate, clear, and free of misleading statements.
    
- **Avoiding Offensive Language**:
    
    Creators must refrain from using any negative, offensive, or foul language throughout the video. This includes profanities, slurs, or any language that can be deemed inappropriate for a general audience.
    
- **Inclusion and Respect**:
    - **No Discrimination**: Creators must avoid any form of discrimination against race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or ethnicity in their content.
    - **Cultural Sensitivity**: Be mindful of cultural references and context that may be offensive or misinterpreted by other cultures.

### 5. **Rules for Video Makers**

To maintain consistency and quality, all creators must follow these specific rules:

- **Language & Translation**:
    - **Local Language Videos**: All videos recorded in a local language must provide English subtitles for a wider audience. Creators should ensure that translations are accurate.
    - **Verbatim Translations**: For videos translated from English to other languages, subtitles or voiceovers should be verbatim, ensuring no additional commentary or misleading interpretations outside the original context.
- **Accuracy**:
    
    All content must be factual and align with the intended curriculum. Creators should avoid adding information that deviates from the established Python curriculum or inserting personal opinions unless relevant to the topic.
    
- **Source Citation**:
    
    If any external resources, data, or code snippets are used, creators must properly cite their sources to avoid plagiarism.

### 6. **Appearance and Presentation Standards**

- **Dress Code**:
    
    All creators appearing on camera must dress appropriately. Nudity, offensive imagery, or inappropriate attire will not be tolerated. Dress professionally, keeping in mind that the videos are educational and watched by a wide range of audiences.
    
- **Videos for Children**:
    
    Any videos aimed at children should be clearly labeled as such and adhere to all guidelines for content made for children (no offensive language, age-appropriate materials, etc.).

### 7. **Content Labeling and Classification**

- **Target Audience**:
    
    Videos should clearly state their intended audience (e.g., beginners, intermediates, advanced learners) to help users find content suitable for their skill level.
    
- **Kid-Friendly Label**:
    
    Any videos specifically designed for children should include a "kids label" and follow strict guidelines to ensure the content is age-appropriate.

### 8. **Technical Considerations**

- **File Formats**:
    
    All videos should be saved and submitted in common formats (e.g., MP4) to ensure compatibility across platforms.
    
- **Video Length**:
    
    While there's flexibility, it’s generally advisable to keep each video concise and focused on one topic. Videos should ideally range between 5 to 20 minutes, depending on the complexity of the subject.
    
- **Consistency**:
    
    Stick to a consistent video format for uniformity across the channel. For example, each video should start with a brief introduction, followed by the lesson, and end with a conclusion or a call to action.

### 9. **Community Focus and Reward System**

Creators are encouraged to engage with the community and provide high-quality content. Each video or series of videos may have associated rewards based on the quality of content, adherence to guidelines, and community engagement.

- **Rewarding Top Creators**:
Creators who consistently produce excellent content and follow the guidelines will be eligible for rewards and recognition within the PythonVids community.

### 10. **Submission Process**

Creators must submit their videos for review before publication. The review process will ensure that all videos meet the required standards
